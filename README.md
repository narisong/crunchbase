# Crunchbase People

## Context

I use Crunchbase a lot. I use it mostly to query the funding and founders information of startup companies. The feature that allows one-click to founders' LinkedIn page is only available for premium subscription, I don't use it enough to justify paying for it. So I have to copy founders name and search it on LinkedIn manually. This becomes a pain over the time. So I decided to create a Chrome extension so that I can navigate to founders LinkedIn page with a single click.

## Get started

1. Install it from Chrome Web Store
1. Open [Crunchbase](https://crunchbase.com) and find the company you want to query. For example, [Nuro](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nuro-2)
1. Navigate to the [People](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nuro-2/people) page of the company
1. Open __Crunchbase People__ Chrome extension from the top right corner of Chrome
1. The popup window lists the people and their titles that are available from the Crunchbase's page
1. Click them and it will open a new tab which leads to their LinkedIn page. For example, [Dave Ferguson of Nuro](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Dave%20Ferguson%20Nuro&sid=r60)

## Hope you like it. Feel free to rate the extension and leave a comment. Cheers
